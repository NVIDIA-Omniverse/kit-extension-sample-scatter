This extension sample also includes a step-by-step tutorial to accelerate your growth as you learn to build your own Omniverse Kit extensions. 

In the tutorial you will learn how to build off exisitng modules using `Omniverse Ui Framework` and create `Scatter Properties`. Additionally, the tutorial has a `Final Scripts` folder to use as a reference as you go along.

Then, set your `Scatter Properties` and click the `Scatter` button.
